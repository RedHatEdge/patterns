# Edge Architecture Patterns

This repo is a collection of blocks and patterns that can be used for communicating concepts, code, and ideas around operating edge landscapes.

## Blocks
[Blocks](./blocks/) are consumable topics intended to be used to highlight a specific concept or idea in a consumable way. They should be limited in scope, as to be easily understood on their own.

## Available Blocks
| Name | Description | Status |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| [Kubernetes Core Concepts](./blocks/k8s-core-concepts/README.md) | A brief introduction to kubernetes concepts | :white_check_mark: |
| [Getting Started with Helm](./blocks/helm-getting-started/README.md) | A brief introduction to Helm | :white_check_mark: |
| [GitOps Deployment to Kubernetes](./blocks/gitops-deployment-k8s/README.md) | Getting started with GitOps | :white_check_mark: |
| [GitOps Cluster Configuration Permissions](./blocks/gitops-cluster-config-rbac/README.md) | Giving OpenShift GitOps cluster-level permissions | :white_check_mark: |
| [Scaling GitOps Deployments](./blocks/scaling-gitops-deployment-k8s/README.md) | Scaling up GitOps deployments | :x:


## Patterns
[Patterns](./patterns/) are blcoks that have been assembled to create something more akin to a full architecture or deployment. They use one to many blocks, and highlight how individual concepts are integrated together.
